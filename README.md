# DigitGAN: Generative Adversarial Networks for MNIST Digits

This project implements Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate handwritten digit images similar to those in the MNIST dataset. It offers two model architectures and training options, allowing experimentation with different GAN approaches.

## Quick Start

1.  **Set up environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    .\venv\Scripts\activate # or source venv/bin/activate on linux
    ```

2.  **Configure settings:** Adjust hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and noise amount in `settings.cfg`.

3.  **Train a model:**
    *   **Option 1:** Train a Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) with `TorchTrainerDCGAN.py`. This is the recommended option for best results.
    *   **Option 2:** Train a simple Deep Neural Network GAN with `TorchTrainer.py`.

4.  **View results:**
    *   Rename the best epoch's generator model file (e.g., `GenModelE100.pth`) in the model's folder to `GenModel.pth`.
    *   Set the `filename` variable in `ViewResults.py` to the model's folder name.
    *   Run `ViewResults.py` to see generated digits and interactively explore the model.

## Project Details

### 1. Hyperparameters and Model Architecture

*   **`settings.cfg`:** Controls training parameters. Modify these to optimize performance.
*   **`TorchModels.py`:** Contains definitions for the generator and discriminator models. Here, you can adjust the size and structure of hidden layers for experimentation.
*   **Training Files:** `TorchTrainer.py` trains a fully connected network and `TorchTrainerDCGAN.py` trains a convolutional network for image generation. They both instantiate the models based on the specified hyperparameters.

### 2. Training

The training process involves two competing models:

*   **Generator:** Attempts to create realistic images from random noise and class labels.
*   **Discriminator:** Tries to distinguish between real images from the MNIST dataset and fake images generated by the generator.

This adversarial process pushes both models to improve over time.

### 3. Viewing Results

The `ViewResults.py` script helps analyze generated digits:

*   **Preview:** Displays generated images for all ten digits (0-9) in a grid.
*   **Interactive Mode:**  Allows you to generate and view single images based on specified digit labels. This enables further model exploration
